              SOMERVILLE, Massachusetts — I remember getting my first library
              card when I was 8 years old. I was on a school field trip, and
              after patiently waiting in line behind my 2nd grade classmates, I
              took the pen from the librarian and proudly etched my initials
              onto the back of my new, blue, Minute-Man library card.
            </p>

            <p>
              My world had changed. Soon, I was devouring every
              <em>Magic Treehouse</em> book I could lay my hands on, surfing
              through the vast sea of Wikipedia, and constantly losing myself in
              the nooks and crannies of the Somerville Public Library.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm sad that I no longer experience the same rush of joy and
              excitement whenver I pick up a new book, but it seems like I'm not
              alone. Over the past few years, Americans have slowly been falling
              out of touch with the public library system. From 2000 to 2018,
              libraries observed a
              <a
                href="https://www.aei.org/politics-and-public-opinion/if-libraries-are-about-finding-the-truth-lets-be-honest-about-their-decline/"
                >31 percent decline</a
              >
              in overall use, despite the fact that government, state, and local
              funding for them has increased. Additionally, the COVID pandemic
              and the rise in technology has led many Americans to spend
              significantly less time reading and more time on their devices, a
              trend that has
              <a

                >remained steady since 2010.
              </a>
            </p>

            <p>
              If libraries have been losing popularity for the past twenty
              years, why do we continue to spend
              <a
                href="https://www.aei.org/politics-and-public-opinion/if-libraries-are-about-finding-the-truth-lets-be-honest-about-their-decline/"
                >$13.37 billion dollars each year</a
              >
              to keep our public libraries up and running? Are there better
              places this money can go to? Is it finally time to move on from
              these outdated institutions?
            </p>

            <p>
              Historically, public libraries have played a key role in combating
              poverty and equalizing access to information across all social,
              racial, and economic groups. Part of the problem is that when
              low-income families have to choose between buying food, paying the
              bills, or covering medical expenses, books are often the last item
              that comes to mind — a harsh reality reflected in the
              <a
                href="https://www.comicrelief.org/posts/changing-illiteracy-in-the-u-s-with-early-initiatives#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20case%20for,access%20to%20them%20at%20home."
                >60% of low-income families</a
              >
              in America who are unable afford books. This early disadvantage
              often translates into long-term consequences for students'
              academic prospects:
              <a
                href="https://www.lexialearning.com/blog/examining-link-between-poor-literacy-skills-and-dropout"
                >one longitudinal study</a
              >
              of 4,000 kids found that "students who were not reading
              proficiently by third grade were almost four times more likely to
              leave school without earning their diploma."
            </p>

            <p>
              Without having to worry about obtaining school supplies, stable
              internet, or working through other issues at home, public
              libraries have emerged as one of the few places where young
              children from poor backgrounds can learn freely, exposing
              themselves to abstract ideas they may have never come across
              before. For adults, the fact that public libraries have remained
              public has allowed countlesss immigrants, refugees, workers, and
              families to access the same social and digital capital as their
              well-off peers.
            </p>

            <p>
              Computers are the perfect example of this type of social capital
              that public libraries have been offering for decades. In a study
              conducted by
              <a
                href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2010/03/millions-of-people-rely-on-library-computers-for-employment-health-and-education"
                >the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,</a
              >
              they learned that “44 percent of people living below the federal
              poverty line [have] relied on computers and the Internet at their
              public libraries” - more internet usage than any other
              socioeconomic class. Just 30 minutes on the computer could help a
              person send a job application, seek training, or begin a resume.
              These statistics underscore the value of libraries as a mechanism
              for promoting upward mobility; even though overall readership is
              declining, libraries help provide individuals with the resources
              and technology needed to thrive.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my research, what I wanted to uncover was where libraries were
              <em>failing</em>. Money, to my surprise, wasn't the issue; public
              libraries have seen
              <a
                href="https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/Value-Added-Budgets-Budgets-and-funding-2023#:~:text=Two%2Dthirds%20of%20municipal%20libraries,and%2038%20percent%20in%202020."
                >extremely strong increases in funding</a
              >
              especially after COVID, and the average library now receives
              around $836,810 in government assistance.
            </p>

            <p>
              But when I came across Sei-Ching Joanna Sin's paper on
              <a
                href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/meet.2008.1450450263"
                >disparities across public libraries</a
              >, I was intrigued at the fact that lower-income, rural
              communities tended to have "shorter hours, less staff and
              programs, and [a] smaller collection size” than more urban
              neighborhoods. Her work was published in 2009. Would I find the
              same social inequities in the data from 2019 if I looked at
              poverty, race, and class?

              </blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>
              After combining racial and socioeconomic data from
              <a href="https://www.census.gov/">U.S. Census</a> with information
              from the
              <a
                href="https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/data-collection/public-libraries-survey"
                >2019 Public Library Survey</a
              >, I discovered that not only do public libraries in the most
              concentrated Black communities offer 5.2x more children and young
              adult programs than majority White neighborhoods, but they also
              receive about 6x as much attendance. In 2019 alone, an average of
              30,000 people attended these programs in libraries located in the
              most Black communities.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I looked at race, household income, and poverty rate, each
              identifier told the same story, but in its own distinct voice:
              low-income communities stand to benefit the most from community
              building programs hosted at public libraries, and America,
              unfortunately, is missing out on a lot of this potential. If you
              want to see it, just look at the map for yourself.
            </p>

            <p>
              I fully recognize that there are likely disparities that I still
              missed, inequities that I didn't address, and nuances that I
              failed to capture, and yet still, the results speak for
              themselves. Seeing public libraries as simply places to store,
              lend, and borrow books is the wrong way to look at them. Buying
              more books will not solve the problem of educational and
              informational inequity. People don't just rely on libraries for
              the books. They seek the community and the resources they haven't
              been able to find, too caught up in the hustle and bustle of
              working multiple jobs, trying to raise families, and struggling
              all along the way.
            </p>

            <p>
              To address the severe educational inequities across all social
              groups, we need to start by allocating more funding to K-8 schools
              specifically so that teachers can set up their own libraries
              inside their classrooms. The current problem is that many
              low-income parents aren't able to take days off from work, and so
              finding time to go to the library can pose as a serious challenge.
              If the goal is to put books in the hands of young kids -
              particularly low-income ones - the ideal solution would be to
              bring the books <em>to</em> them - not the other way around.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the core of this, however, I want to reimagine what a "library"
              is. Almost every public library hosts these types of programs, but
              these programs feel only secondary to the library's "true purpose"
              of distributing books. There is an untapped potential waiting in
              these book-centered institutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Imagine if every public library was turned in a Community Center,
              where books were only one example of the many services a hub like
              this would offer: a community fridge to help support food-insecure
              families, translation services for immigrants and refugees,
              career-building workshops to help job seekers craft their own
              resumes.
            </p>

            <p>
              If our goal is to help lift these underresourced communities out
              of poverty and into prosperity, eliminating the barriers to education
              and wellbeing is our first and foremost priority. For years,
              public libraries have contributed to the war against economic
              inequality by providing quality resources, support systems, and knowledge
              to the communites who have come to depend on them the most.
